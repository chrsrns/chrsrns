### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

- I write code a lot.
- I'm currently looking to learn Rust technologies applied to apps and web.
- I'm really interested in applying AI technologies to upcoming projects.
- You can reach me at aranaschristianlouise@gmail.com.


Feel free to look at [my projects portal](https://chrsrns.github.io/personal-projects-portal/) to see my (relatively) complete pet projects.

Feel free to also look at [my online resume](https://chrsrns.github.io/css-resume/), which I [coded myself](https://github.com/chrsrns/css-resume), to see an overview of my credentials.
